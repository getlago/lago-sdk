**name** | **str** | The name of the plan. | [optional]

**code** | **str** | The code of the plan. It serves as a unique identifier associated with a particular plan. The code is typically used for internal or system-level identification purposes, like assigning a subscription, for instance. | [optional] 
**interval** | **str** | The interval used for recurring billing. It represents the frequency at which subscription billing occurs. The interval can be one of the following values: &#x60;yearly&#x60;, &#x60;quarterly&#x60;, &#x60;monthly&#x60;, or &#x60;weekly&#x60;. | [optional] 
**description** | **str** | The description on the plan. | [optional] 
**amount_cents** | **int** | The base cost of the plan, excluding any applicable taxes, that is billed on a recurring basis. This value is defined at 0 if your plan is a pay-as-you-go plan. | [optional]

**trial_period** | **float** | The duration in days during which the base cost of the plan is offered for free. | [optional]
