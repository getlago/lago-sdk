| Name | Type | Description | Notes |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- | ----- |
| **code** | **String** | The code that identifies a targeted billable metric. It is essential that this code matches the &#x60;code&#x60; property of one of your active billable metrics. If the provided code does not correspond to any active billable metric, it will be ignored during the process. |  |
| **external_customer_id** | **String** | The customer external unique identifier (provided by your own application). This field is optional if you send the &#x60;external_subscription_id&#x60;, targeting a specific subscription. | [optional] |
| **external_subscription_id** | **String** | The unique identifier of the subscription within your application. It is a mandatory field when the customer possesses multiple subscriptions or when the &#x60;external_customer_id&#x60; is not provided. | [optional] |
| **properties** | **Object** | This field represents additional properties associated with the event, which are utilized in the calculation of the final fee. This object becomes mandatory when the targeted billable metric employs a &#x60;sum_agg&#x60;, &#x60;max_agg&#x60;, or &#x60;unique_count_agg&#x60; aggregation method.
