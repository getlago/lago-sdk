**external_customer_id** | **string** | The customer external unique identifier (provided by your own application). This field is optional if you send the &#x60;external_subscription_id&#x60;, targeting a specific subscription. | [optional]
**external_subscription_id** | **string** | The unique identifier of the subscription within your application. It is a mandatory field when the customer possesses multiple subscriptions or when the &#x60;external_customer_id&#x60; is not provided. | [optional]
**properties** | **object** | This field represents additional properties associated with the event, which are utilized in the calculation of the final fee. This object becomes mandatory when the targeted billable metric employs a &#x60;sum_agg&#x60;, &#x60;max_agg&#x60;, or &#x60;unique_count_agg&#x60; aggregation method.
